Get Started:
1. When loading the project into Visual Studio Code, load from the root folder where the client and server folders originate.
2. Make sure that your terminal directory is set to the root folder
3. Use the command "npm run initSetup" to install all necessary packages
4. Use the command "npm run start" to start the server and client. A browser window will automatically open for debugging.

NOTE: This setup is working for the latest stable (recommended) version of Node.js, Visual Studio Code, and Google Chrome.
If you need to add a different browser, use the launch.json file created by VSC and be sure to use port 19006 

When Getting Updates:
1. Before running the program after an update, make sure you are pointed in the root folder and use the command "npm run setup"
2. Still in the root folder, use the command "npm run start"

Starting the program:
1. In the root folder, use the command "npm run start"
